# User Registration

Create an Express HTTP server that contains middleware to handle POST /users requests with username and password key-value pairs in the request body. Ensure the middleware takes the following steps.

Generate a hashed_password using the bcrypt cryptographic hash function.
Insert the username and hashed_password into a users table.
Respond with just a 200 status code on successful insertion into the table.
Be sure to pass along any errors to the error handling middleware in the stack. For good measure, include a 404 catch-all middleware in the stack as well.

As a bonus, ensure the middleware takes the following steps:

Respond with a 400 status code if either the username or password is blank.
Respond with a 400 status code if a row with the same username already exists in the users table.
